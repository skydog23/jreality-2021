Contains all jReality shading-related classes and interfaces.

Technically each backend is responsible for reading the state of the {@link Appearance}
hierarchy and rendering correctly.  In practice this  This includes utility classes for 
keeping track of Appearance attributes; classes supporting a variety of texture maps, from simple images
to relection maps, shadow maps, and reflection maps; plus a variety of interfaces which encapsulate the 
functionality of the standard shaders: these can be thought of as an organizing layer 
between the raw Appearance and the specific backend implementation of the various shaders.
