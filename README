There is an incompatibility between Java 5 and Java 6 which effects the ant build.  In order
for the ant build to function correctly, edit the file excludes.txt in this directory and follow the directions there.

If you wish to use the JOGL backend, the jReality release includes the necessary native libraries in the 
folder jni -- select the subfolder based on your environment, and add to your JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH.  If using
eclipse and the .project file included with the jReality release, 
    1) inspect the 'Properties' of src-core  folder in the Package Exploreer (right-mouse context menu)
    2) make sure that the native library location attached to the src-core folder points to the right subfolder of jni.
